# README

This project used scaffold which
- generates files some are needed some are not needed
-- migration file for create restaurant
-- restaurant model
-- routes
-- controller which is alreay coded
- in general scaffold is not used due to the unwanted files
- not good for learning
- only for lecture, challenges should not use this
`rails g scaffold Restaurant name address stars:integer`
